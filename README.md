# TAS

Test assigment to demonstrate ability to work with smart contracts. The majority of the work is inside `EnergyMarket.sol` and `App.js`.

## Dependencies

This project has been developed on Linux and no effort has been spent to make it compatible with other operating systems.

* jq
* xfce4-terminal
* testRPC, truffle, yarn, etc...

## How to run

Check out the code and execute `./start.sh <your metamask address>`. Open the browser console to see what is going on. Note that MetaMask will not correctly keep track of the nonce between restarts of testRPC; you need to switch to a different network and back.
